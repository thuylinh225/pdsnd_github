There are 8 parts:

    - The first part: asking users which city, month and day that they would like to choose.

    - The second part: loading data of city, month and day base on users request.

    - The third part: displays statistics on the most frequent times of travel, includes:
          + The most common month
          + The most common day of week
          + The most common start hour
          + How long does it run the third part.

    - The next part: displays statistics on the most popular stations and trip, includes:
          + The most commonly used start station
          + The most commonly used end station is
          + The most frequent combination of start station and end station trip
          + How long does it run this part.

    - The next part: displays statistics on the total and average trip duration, includes:
          + Total travel time
          + Average travel time
